# NoSQL-Challenge-Social-Network-API

## Description:
This is a walkthrough on showing the ability to create a user, add friends, delete a user, create their thoughts or reactions, update their thoughts, and delete the thoughts and or reactoins. This application uses MongoDB to run the following abilities. 

## Test routes.

Here are the test routes that are requested for this assignment. 
/api/users
/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId
/api/thoughts
/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions

With the walk through  videos I have seperated this into each section to make it easier to follow.
